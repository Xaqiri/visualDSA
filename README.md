Various data structures and algorithms implemented graphically.  
All will be done in Python + Pygame initially, but I plan to implement at least some of them in various other languages.  

Bubble Sort: 
  - Currently only implemented in Python + Pygame (3.5.1 + 1.9.2b1)
  - Press the backspace key to restart the algorithm 
  - Press the spacebar to restart the algorithm using the worst case scenario (i.e. bars sorted largest to smallest) 
  - Press the a key to double the number of bars
